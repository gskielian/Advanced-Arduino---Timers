AVR-TIMERS
==========

Part of the advanced Arduino Series.

### Chapters:

- Tour of the AVR Atmega328p (actual pinout and discussion)
- Size Optimization (the microcontroller memory squeeze)
- Speed Optimization (digital write pinmode)
- Timers (this chapter)
  - controlling ESC brushlesss motors (flight control, UBERFAST RC CARS)
- using the command line to program the arduino
  - option 1: ino
  - option 2: avr-gcc (Crosspack for Mac)[file:///usr/local/CrossPack-AVR/manual/index.html] 
  - option 3: not through the arduino but using the specialized cable

** We will have a generic Makefile and hello world in a Repository for easy downloading. **

### Supplementary units:

- Oscilloscope usage for probing

### Suggested Previous Courses:

- Introductory Unix shell environment
- introductory VIM for command line usage
- Getting With Git (which is version control we use for all courseware)
